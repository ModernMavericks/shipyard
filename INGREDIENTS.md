# Build ingredients

Everything baked into what shipyard ships, and how a change to it reaches a release. shipyard compiles
nothing: it ships CMake modules, shell scripts, and the Sparkle updater template every product renders.
Its "build inputs" are therefore the things those scripts fetch on a consumer's behalf.

This repo is consumed through a **moving** tag. Fifteen repos pin `@v1`, so anything merged here reaches
all of them within minutes — which is why the version is derived from the commit count (see
`scripts/shipyard-version.sh`) rather than bumped by hand.

| Ingredient | Pinned in | Renovate | On a bump |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sparkle 1.27.3 (updater framework) | `MavericksSparkle.cmake` (`mavericks_fetch_sparkle`) | ❌ **untrackable** by a standard manager: the version is a literal inside a CMake function, not a dependency declaration. Deliberate — Sparkle 1.x is the last line supporting 10.9, so a bump is a decision, not a routine update. | hand-edit, then the next push cuts a version like any other change |
| MacOSX10.9 SDK | `scripts/fetch_sdk.sh` (`MAVERICKS_SDK_URL` + `MAVERICKS_SDK_SHA256`, phracker/MacOSX-SDKs 11.3) | ❌ **untrackable**: pinned by SHA-256 against a frozen third-party release. There is no newer 10.9 SDK to move to; the pin exists to prove the bytes, not to track a stream. | n/a — a change here would mean a different SDK, which is a deliberate port decision |
| GitHub Actions (`actions/checkout@v7`, `actions/download-artifact@v8`, `actions/setup-python@v7`, `actions/upload-artifact@v7`, `softprops/action-gh-release@v3`) | `.github/workflows/*.yml` | ✅ native `github-actions` manager | automerges on green (`ship-if-green`), and the merge itself cuts the next shipyard version |
| `bats` (shell test driver) | installed by `.github/actions/install` from the platform package manager | ✅ tracked by the package manager, not pinned here | a new bats reaches CI on its next run; the suites are version-agnostic |
| shipyard's own version | `UPSTREAM_VERSION` (the **line**) + `git rev-list --count` | n/a — first-party | every push to `main` cuts `<line>.<count>`; `@v1` moves to it |
